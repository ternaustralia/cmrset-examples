### Google Earth Engine Python Examples

These code examples will demonstrate how you can access the [CMRSET Landsat](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TERN_AET_CMRSET_LANDSAT_V2_2) Actual Evapotranspiration data product via the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) catalogue. To run these examples it is assumed you have [registered](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/) to Google Earth Engine. Please feel free to adapt these examples to meet your own requirements.

You can run these examples directly in your browser via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) using the direct links below:
